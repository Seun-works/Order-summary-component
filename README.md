## Overview

### The challenge


This project primarily focused on the hover states of the buttons and links on the order summary.




### Links

- Live Site URL: [Live Project site](https://seun-works.github.io/Order-summary-component/)

## My process

The main purpose of this project was to work on my custom CSS and also make use of flexbox and grid.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- SASS




### What I learned

At the begiining of my coding journey, i wasnt really comfortable with css so i relied on learnin a framework like bootstrap. This project helped me to understand that custom css in some cases is easier than using a framework.



### Continued development

- Become more comfortable with using custom css.
- Learning more about flexbox and grid.

### Useful resources

- [CSS tricks](hhttps://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/#flexbox-background) - This helped me for knowing the basics of flexbox. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
